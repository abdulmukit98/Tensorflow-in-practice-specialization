2 What is Quantization?

    A technique that reduces precision and model size to work better on mobile


3 The TFLite file format is an example of what

    A flatbuffer
    

4 Question 4
Which types of input does the TF Lite Convertor API Accept (Check all that apply)

    A set of concrete functions

    A SavedModel

    A Keras HDF5 file


5 True or False: The SavedModel format supports model Versioning

    True


6 If I want to save an existing Keras model, what’s the API signature:

      tf.saved_model.save(model, path)



7 If I want to use the TensorFlow Lite Convertor to convert a saved model to TF Lite, what’s the API signature?

    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(path) newModel = converter.convert()



8 If I have a keras model and want to convert it, what’s the method signature on TFLiteConverter

    from_keras_model(model)

9  If I want to convert using a command line tool, what’s the name of the tool?

    tflite_convert
